# Simple Todo List App

**Objective:** Develop a basic to-do list app using React and Material UI in this Vite project. This app will allow users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. The primary focus is on frontend development, user interaction, and state management within the app.

## Requirements

- App features
  - Add Task: Users can add a new task with a brief description.
  - Mark Task as Complete: Users can mark tasks as complete, which visually distinguishes them from incomplete tasks.
  - Delete Task: Users can delete a task from the list.
  - Task List: Display all tasks in a list view, showing both complete and incomplete tasks.
- User Interface:
  - Create a clean and intuitive user interface. Use Material UI to accomplish this, ensuring all components of the app are responsive.
  - Ensure the app provides visual feedback for user interactions (e.g., completing or deleting a task).
- State Management:
  - Use local component state to manage the tasks. No local storage or database is needed.
  - Demonstrate basic understanding of state and props in React Native.
- Documentation:
  - Include a README.md file with:
    - Instructions for setting up and running the app.
    - A brief overview of the app's features and any special instructions for using it.
    - Mention any third-party libraries used and their purpose in the project.

## Notes

- Make sure to comment the code cleanly, but do not excessively comment, especially in areas where understanding what the code is doing is trivial.
- Make sure the code is clean and organized.
